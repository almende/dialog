# Introduction

One important part of CHAP is the hybrid nature of the agent models. To facilitate the interaction between agents and humans the "Dialog" toolset provides the means for multi-channel communication. This project contains tools for describing the meta-structure of dialogs, the exchange of dialog data (texts, sounds, etc.) and an adapter design for plug-in media. 

## Protocol

The base of the Dialog toolset is a JSON-based protocol for describing the meta structure of the conversation. This protocol is medium independent and therefore facilitates multi-channel conversations between the agent and humans.
Please refer to: <a href="protocol.html">protocol</a> for a indepth description of the protocol.
