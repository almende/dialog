DESCRIPTION


The Dialog is a collection of tools and APIs, aimed at supporting human-agent interaction. Although it's meant to provide a full conversation-level dialog, the original implementation is mainly aimed at letting agents ask questions.

The Dialog consists of:

    >> Dialog standard JSON API
    >> HTML5/JS implementation for integration into web applications
    >> Google Appengine implementation for large scale dialog resource serving, especially aimed to interface with social media.
    >> VoiceXML implementation
